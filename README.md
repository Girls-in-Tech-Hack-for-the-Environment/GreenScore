# **Introduction 🚀**


### GreenScore: AI-Powered Sustainability Insight
GreenScore leverages AI to shed light on corporate recycling practices in a world where less than 9% of plastic is recycled. Our platform empowers consumers and organizations alike to track, compare, and improve recycling performance across industries. Join GreenScore to promote informed decisions and spark a change for a greener planet.

## **Use Case 💬**

-  Consumer Awareness:A consumer wants to make more environmentally-friendly purchases. They use this system to scan products while shopping, helping them choose products from companies with higher recycling program scores. The AI system enables the user to make informed decisions based on the environmental impact of their choices.

- Company Benchmarking: A company wishes to understand where they stand in terms of environmental friendliness compared to competitors. They use this AI system to benchmark their recycling reward program and identify areas for improvement.

- Transparency:  Companies will be encouraged to continue and improve their environmental efforts as the app continues to display, rank and share the data on their achievements and shortfalls.

- Research and Analysis: An environmental research organization uses this system to track and analyze recycling program trends across various industries. It allows them to quickly gather data, freeing up time to focus on analysis and reporting.

- Regulatory Compliance: Government agencies can use the system to monitor companies' recycling programs and ensure they are meeting environmental standards and regulations. If a company's score is low, they can investigate further to understand the reasons behind it.

- Environmental Advocacy:Nonprofit environmental organizations can use the system to encourage companies to improve their recycling programs. They can highlight companies with high scores as examples of good corporate environmental responsibility, and advocate for those with low scores to improve their practices.

- Educational Tool: In a classroom setting, teachers can use this system to show students the impact of recycling programs and discuss the role of companies in environmental sustainability. It serves as a practical tool to supplement theoretical learning.

## **Tools Used 🛠**

### we've harnessed a mix of advanced tools and technologies, each contributing a unique aspect to our project:

Figma: Used for crafting an intuitive and user-friendly design interface, Figma has helped us visualize the user experience and streamline our development process.

Hugging Face Model: Leveraging the power of AI, we utilized the Hugging Face Model to recognize and download images of specific brands. This has not only saved us countless hours but also significantly improved the precision of our data.

ReactJS: As our chosen JavaScript library for building the user interface, ReactJS allowed us to create reusable UI components, ensuring a consistent and engaging user experience across the platform.

Python: Python was instrumental for automation and Natural Language Processing (NLP). It has played a pivotal role in transforming user inputs into actionable data and generating meaningful output.

LangChain AI: This tool was employed to return data that we seamlessly integrated into our table format, making it easy for users to interact with and understand the information presented.

ChatGPT: Our core AI model, ChatGPT, processes user inputs in a structured prompt format and produces coherent, relevant outputs. This technology forms the backbone of our platform, powering our data analysis and generating insights about recycling practices.
