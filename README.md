### GreenScore: AI-Powered Sustainability Insight

*Accountability through transparency*

GreenScore leverages AI to shed light on corporate recycling practices in a world where less than 9% of plastic is recycled. Our platform empowers consumers and organizations alike to track, compare, and improve recycling performance across industries. Join GreenScore to promote informed decisions and spark a change for a greener planet.

## **Use Case 💬**

- Consumer Awareness:A consumer wants to make more environmentally-friendly purchases. They use this system to scan products while shopping, helping them choose products from companies with higher recycling program scores. The AI system enables the user to make informed decisions based on the environmental impact of their choices.
- Company Benchmarking: A company wishes to understand where they stand in terms of environmental friendliness compared to competitors. They use this AI system to benchmark their recycling reward program and identify areas for improvement.
- Research and Analysis: An environmental research organization uses this system to track and analyze recycling program trends across various industries. It allows them to quickly gather data, freeing up time to focus on analysis and reporting.
- Regulatory Compliance: Government agencies can use the system to monitor companies' recycling programs and ensure they are meeting environmental standards and regulations. If a company's score is low, they can investigate further to understand the reasons behind it.
- Environmental Advocacy:Nonprofit environmental organizations can use the system to encourage companies to improve their recycling programs. They can highlight companies with high scores as examples of good corporate environmental responsibility, and advocate for those with low scores to improve their practices.
- Educational Tool: In a classroom setting, teachers can use this system to show students the impact of recycling programs and discuss the role of companies in environmental sustainability. It serves as a practical tool to supplement theoretical learning.

## **Motivation 💡**

Plastic production has been on a rapid increase since its initial inception in the early 1900s, with production comes waste unfortunately. According to [IUCN](https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/marine-plastic-pollution#:~:text=Over%20400%20million%20tons%20of,waters%20to%20deep%2Dsea%20sediments.), approximately 14 million tonnes of plastic end up in the ocean every year! This is a terrifying statistic and something we need to address. 

Reducing plastic waste globally is essential for several important reasons:

1. **Environmental Impact:** Plastic waste has a significant negative impact on the environment. Plastic takes hundreds of years to decompose, and even when it does, it breaks down into microplastics that can persist in the environment for much longer. These microplastics can infiltrate ecosystems, harm wildlife, and potentially enter the food chain, posing risks to both animals and humans.
2. **Wildlife Protection:** Plastic waste often ends up in oceans, rivers, and other natural habitats. Marine animals can mistake plastic for food, leading to ingestion and potential harm or death. This is detrimental to biodiversity and the health of ecosystems.
3. **Human Health:** Microplastics have been found in drinking water, seafood, and even the air we breathe. While the long-term health effects on humans are still being studied, there are concerns that the ingestion of microplastics and the chemicals associated with plastics could have adverse health effects.
4. **Resource Depletion:** Plastics are typically derived from petroleum and natural gas, finite resources that have environmental and geopolitical implications. By reducing plastic production and waste, we can conserve these valuable resources.
5. **Climate Change:** The production of plastics is energy-intensive and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing plastic production and waste, we can help mitigate the impacts of climate change.
6. **Aesthetic and Economic Impact:** Plastic waste can be unsightly and impact the aesthetics of landscapes and urban areas, affecting tourism and overall quality of life. It can also lead to economic costs, such as the expense of cleaning up litter and addressing the environmental damage caused by plastic waste.
7. **Long-Term Sustainability:** A global reduction in plastic waste is crucial for the long-term sustainability of the planet. By transitioning to more sustainable materials and reducing our reliance on single-use plastics, we can create a healthier and more resilient environment for future generations.

Countries across the world have each began to introduce policies and legislation to limit and reduce the amounts of virgin plastic being produced and increase recycling efforts, however we feel that more needs to be done to tackle the colossal volume of plastic bottles produced by the beverage industry every year. As said by Oceana, the largest international organization dedicated to ocean conservation, “Beverage companies are major ocean polluters and are producing billions of plastic bottles every year that end up in the sea essentially forever,” said Oceana CEO Andy Sharpless. “They need to take responsibility and make commitments to reduce plastic production and waste.”

Most of the major companies already have existing policies and goals to improve their sustainability and reduce their carbon footprint, however this is not moving fast enough. We feel that by introducing our product, GreenScore, beverage companies will be held accountable by the transparent nature of the product. GreenScore will encourage consumers to check which companies are doing the best environmentally. In a bid to retain consumers and improve their sustainable reputation beverage companies will feel the competition and drive to continue to progress with their environmental policies and reduce their carbon footprint. We believe that this continuous cycle will feed the drive for companies to continue to improve as consumers continue to vet the best company.

## **Tools Used 🛠**

### we've harnessed a mix of advanced tools and technologies, each contributing a unique aspect to our project:

Figma: Used for crafting an intuitive and user-friendly design interface, Figma has helped us visualize the user experience and streamline our development process.

Hugging Face Model: Leveraging the power of AI, we utilized the Hugging Face Model to recognize and download images of specific brands. This has not only saved us countless hours but also significantly improved the precision of our data.

ReactJS: As our chosen JavaScript library for building the user interface, ReactJS allowed us to create reusable UI components, ensuring a consistent and engaging user experience across the platform.

Python: Python was instrumental for automation and Natural Language Processing (NLP). It has played a pivotal role in transforming user inputs into actionable data and generating meaningful output.

LangChain AI: This tool was employed to return data that we seamlessly integrated into our table format, making it easy for users to interact with and understand the information presented.

ChatGPT: Our core AI model, ChatGPT, processes user inputs in a structured prompt format and produces coherent, relevant outputs. This technology forms the backbone of our platform, powering our data analysis and generating insights about recycling practices.

## **Features 🌟**

**Current Features**

Below is a list of the current features our website has.

1. **Search Bar:** This allows user to do a text search for a brand. It has an autocomplete functionality, so that users can select a brand that already exists in the database.
2. **Image uploader:** This feature will allow users to upload a photo of a bottle, the image uploader will then read the image using Hugging Face and then cross reference this with the brands in the database and return the brand name to the user. 
    
    Describe how this feature works. Does it allow users to upload an image of a product, or do they search by typing in the brand name? How does the search function handle different brand names, misspellings, etc.?
    
3. **Navbar: Will display the different pages available to the user and ensure an easy way for users to navigate the site.**
4. **Data Table:** What kind of data does the dashboard display? How is it organized? How can users interact with it to get the information they need?
